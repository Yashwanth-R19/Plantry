# Plantry

> **A behavior-aware grocery planning assistant that learns from your household's shopping habits to suggest what you might forget.**

Plantry helps users create smarter shopping lists by learning from their own purchase history instead of relying on generic recommendations. It combines lightweight machine learning models with a modern web application to identify frequently bought-together items, forgotten products, and recurring shopping patterns.

---

## Features

*  Smart shopping list creation from natural language input
*  Frequently bought-together item suggestions
*  Forgotten item prediction using probability-based scoring
*  Recurring item reminders based on purchase history
*  User feedback to improve future recommendations
*  Shopping history and household insights
*  Secure authentication with Firebase Authentication

##  Machine Learning

Plantry generates recommendations by combining three lightweight and explainable models:

| Model               | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Association Mining  | Suggests items frequently bought together |
| Bayesian Scoring    | Predicts items commonly forgotten         |
| Temporal Heuristics | Identifies items due for repurchase       |

Models are trained **per household**, making recommendations personalized rather than based on global shopping trends.

##  Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Plantry
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create the required `.env` files from the provided `.env.example` files and configure your Firebase credentials.

---

##  Running the Project

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

The application will be available locally after both services are running.

---

##  Training the Models

After generating shopping history through the application, retrain the recommendation models:

```bash
cd ml-training
node trainAll.js <firebase-user-uid>
```

To test model predictions:

```bash
node testInference.js <firebase-user-uid> milk bread
```

---

##  Security

* Firebase Authentication for user sign-in
* Backend verifies every Firebase ID token
* Firestore is accessed only through the backend
* Each user's data is isolated using their Firebase UID

---

##  Future Improvements

* Multi-user household support
* Automatic model retraining
* Better seasonal and contextual recommendations
* Cross-household pattern learning while preserving privacy
* Smarter natural language understanding

---

> Note: In the deployed webstite, the Looker Studio Visualisation in the Insights page is done from the Data used to Train and Test the ML Models for one particular household
